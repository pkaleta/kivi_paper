This paper describes the design and Haskell implementation of a lazy
programming language called Kivi. It is higly influenced on both Haskell's
syntax as well as the way that computations are performed. However it generates
the \emph{Low Level Virtual Machine}\cite{wiki:llvm} Intermediate
Representation code as the output, which is then assembled and compiled to
native code by LLVM.
